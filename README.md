# Render NodeJS Express Service

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you're using the correct Node version (see `.nvmrc`)
- Run `npm install` to get the required libraries

## Useful scripts

1. Build the distribution: `npm run build`
2. Run the linter: `npm run lint`
3. Run the tests: `npm run test`
4. Generate test coverage: `npm run coverage`

## Running the service

1. Run the development app (runs the app continuously via nodemon and re-compiles on code
   changes): `npm run start:dev`
2. Run the production app: `npm run start:prd`
